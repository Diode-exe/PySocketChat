<!-- # PySocketChat
Client / Server Chat using Python and Sockets.  (Computer Network Programming 2023/2024 Project - @unibo Cesena)

Made by Marco Marrelli, 0001079192 -->

Simple LAN messaging program. Forked from Marco Marrelli's PySocketChat. 

Includes server and client. 

**How to use:**

1. ```git clone https://github.com/Diode-exe/PySocketChat.git```

2. ```cd PySocketChat```

3. Run the server.py on your server and client.py on your client. Make sure to have matching config.py files between them. 

4. msgLog.txt will be created on first message send. Self explanatory.

5. Don't use main.py, it's broken and really doesn't do anything. Feel free to fix it, though.
